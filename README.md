# Human-Activity-Recognition-and-Postural-Transition-dataset-analysis
Abstract: Analisys of the behaviour of non-deep machine learning models such as Support Vector Machine and Random forest for the analysis of an high dimentional dataset for Human Activity Recognition and Postural Transition. Feature distributions are inspected and Principal Component Analisys is exploited to reduce the dataset dimentionality.
